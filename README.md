# IFS
Bachelor project on Iterated functions systems and chaos games.

In this project we investigated a classical application of Banach-Caccioppoli contraction lemma, Iterated function systems.
The set of compact sets of some euclidean finite dimensional space with the usual topology is a complete space if endowed with the Haussdorf metric. This property together with the collage theorem allows to construct sets of maps with interesting fixed points, such as fractals. An applications of this objects is in computer vision, in which often it is useful to save repeated similar patterns in images, and instead of saving more images one can save the set of functions producing them. 
Chaos games are the probabilistic counterpart of IFS, in which the deterministic Picard iteration can be substituted with a randomized counterpart while preserving the convergence to the fixed point (almost surely at least).
In this project we presented the basic foundations of IFS and chaos games, and we implemented a in Mathematica a small graphic interface to easily construct a set of transformations having a desired pre-chosen fixed point.
